# Moisture-Content
The use of Artificial Intelligence to predict the moisture content of a fruit (apple) can be done by use of a model that is capable of predicting the moisture content of an apple given the feature parameters.

Procedure:
A spectral camera utilises near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology to measure the spectral intensity of an apple .The spectral intensity depicts the absorbtion depth of the apple using a predetermined spectral band (wavelenght). The corresponding values of absorption depth for each wavelenght forms the Features variables that can now be conveniently used to predict the moisture content of the apple having implemented a suitable model from the variety provided within the code. Hence,

X = absorption depth for each given wavelength
Y = moisture content to be determined

**Application**
This project finds application in the manufacturing industry among other areas. Since the level of freshness of fruits and vegetables are determined to a large extent by the relative amount of moisture contained in them, it follows that large manufacturing indusries can automate the fruit selection process to make sure that only fresh fruits/vegetables can be processed.
